# Packless

A gear tracker focused on ultralight backpacking. Built as a way to get comfortable with the Deno language/environment, and to push myself and see how much I could build with no dependencies except the Deno standard library (and SQLite).

## Run locally

1. Make sure you have Git and Deno installed
1. Clone this repo and `cd` into it
1. Run `./tasks/dev.sh` to start the dev server
